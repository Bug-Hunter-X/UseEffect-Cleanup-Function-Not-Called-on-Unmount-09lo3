# React useEffect Cleanup Function Not Called on Unmount

This repository demonstrates a scenario where the cleanup function in React's `useEffect` hook might not be called if the component unmounts before the cleanup function has a chance to execute. This can lead to issues like memory leaks or unexpected behavior.

## Problem

The `useEffect` hook provides a way to perform side effects in functional components.  The cleanup function, returned by the `useEffect` callback, is crucial for releasing resources, such as timers, subscriptions, or event listeners, when the component unmounts.  However, if the component unmounts rapidly, before the cleanup function can run, it won't execute.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that the component's lifecycle is managed appropriately and that the cleanup function has sufficient time to execute before unmounting.  Often, refactoring to prevent premature unmounting is necessary. In certain cases, using `useRef` to manage external resources and cleanup based on ref existence can be helpful.
